# Wine_Quality-ML-

Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning algorithms. The predictive model is built and trained using a dataset containing various chemical properties of wines. Different machine learning techniques are explored to develop an accurate model for predicting wine quality.

Project Description
Wine quality prediction is a classic regression problem in machine learning. In this project, we employ machine learning algorithms to analyze chemical characteristics of wines and predict their quality. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, ensuring transparency and ease of reproduction.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes such as acidity, residual sugar, alcohol content, etc., which are indicative of wine quality. The dataset is preprocessed within the Jupyter Notebook to handle missing values, normalize data, and extract relevant features for the machine learning model.

Dependencies
Make sure to have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
